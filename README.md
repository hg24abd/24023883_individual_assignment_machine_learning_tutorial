# Machine Learning Assignment Tutorial

## Overview
Welcome to my **Machine Learning Tutorial** assignment! In this project, I’ve implemented several key machine learning algorithms, used the STL-10 dataset, and evaluated the models with various performance metrics. The tutorial covers data visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Files in This Repository
- **`data/`**: Dataset files used for training and testing.
- **`code/`**: Python scripts that handle the actual machine learning model, training, and evaluation.
- **`notebooks/`**: Colab notebooks with step-by-step explanations and code for executing the tutorial.
- **`README.md`**: This file, which provides all the information you need to run and understand the project.

## What You’ll Need
Before you dive into the code, here’s a quick check on what you need:
- A **Google account** to run the code in Colab.
- Internet connection to access the dataset (unless you upload it manually).

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - First, grab a copy of this project to your local environment or Colab by cloning it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hg24abd/24023883_individual_assignment_machine_learning_tutorial.git
   cd 24023883_individual_assignment_machine_learning_tutorial
   ```

2. **Open in Google Colab**
   - You can easily open the Colab notebook by clicking the link below:
   - [Open `ML_Tutorial.ipynb` in Google Colab]([https://colab.research.google.com/github/hg24abd/24023883_individual_assignment_machine_learning_tutorial/blob/main/notebooks/ML_Tutorial.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1toVTPcDUarh5SM3pSCS89v4l_zCoQdnV?authuser=2#scrollTo=HdW04qRy2Mcg))

3. **Run the Notebook**
   - Once in Colab, run the cells in order. You’ll get visualizations, model training, and performance evaluations.
   - Don’t forget to check the dataset section – you can upload the dataset manually or link it if required.

4. **Training the Model**
   - The notebook will walk you through setting up and training a model on the STL-10 dataset.
   - Key processes include data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Evaluating the Results**
   - The evaluation part covers performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and various visualizations to help you understand how well the model performed.

## A Few Tips for Making a Great Impression:
- **Explain Each Step**: In the Colab notebook, I’ve added explanations alongside the code to make everything easy to understand.
- **Visualize Results**: I’ve used a few plots and charts to visualize model performance, which helps show the process clearly.
- **Keep It Clean and Simple**: The code is organized and readable, which is perfect for understanding the flow and logic.
